Creating websites requires a myriad of skills that are best learned in a classroom setting. It’s possible to land a great job as a self-taught web designer, but completing a college degree program arms a future designer with a comprehensive set of foundational skills they’ll need on a daily basis.

A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.

Freelancers need more coding knowledge, while web designers employed with an agency will likely work on a team that includes programmers and graphic designers.

Web designers often have a wide range of education, from bachelor's degrees in web design and development, computer programming or computer science to associate's degrees coupled with years of work experience. To be able to apply you need to know about web design theory, learn key web design tools, work on your own projects to develop your web design skills, develop a portfolio to showcase your web design work, and apply to relevant web design jobs.
